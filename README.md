# DataMining_Task1_220797069

this is a university home work to implement a pyspark code which count all the data set by their first letter diffrence

1. first subtask is push by the name of spark_VS_hadoop_220797069.docx
2. second subtask is two files bu the name of MR-KNN_220797069.txt/docx
3. third subtask is the file by the name of Spark.py

how to run spark.py : if you can give the code true address of your file. then copy it in bin directory of spark then go  to cmd in spark/bin directory then run 
spark-submit spark.py

and actually the Spark.py code is Colab base and I would put the link in the Colab_Link.txt file to open the file in Colab

thanks
